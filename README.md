## What is MIML library?
MIML is a modular Java library whose aim is to ease the development, testing and comparison of classification algorithms for multi-instance multi-label learning (MIML). It includes three different approaches for solving a MIML problem: transforming the problem to multi-instance, transforming the problem to multi-label problem, and solving directly the MIML problem. Besides, it provides holdout and cross-validation procedures, standard metrics for performance evaluation as well as report generation. Algorithms can be executed by means of *xml* configuration files. It is platform-independent, extensible, free and open source.
